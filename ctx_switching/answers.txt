5. Regarding the variable current_proc: Where has it been defined and what is its significance?

6. In the TimerController class, what does code that reads
 	with self._mutex:
 	    code here... 		
do? I.e., what does with mean in python and why does the code use it? 
- From the comments, we can know that mutex lock to protect setting/getting the countdown. And the code below the 
  self._mutex coppies the value to the countdown, and run the timer within that value.

7. In the TimerController class, explain what the code does when the countdown goes to 0 (i.e., the time expires).
- The timer expires, and it stops generating the interrupts.
